# Snake_Game
The classic game Snake, with optional AI controlled opponent

## Installation
Download the "Snake_Game" folder and put it on your desktop or wherever else feels best for you. The program is written with Processing, and thus it is easily run using this application. Processing can be downloaded here: https://processing.org/download

When you have Processing installed, simply open the Snake_Game folder in Processing and press the "Play" button.

## Usage
The game is my implementation of the classic game "Snake": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)
The game can be played either in singleplayer or multiplayer modes. The snake is controlled using the arrow keys in singleplayer mode, while in multiplayer mode, the firste player uses the arrow keys and the second player uses the WASD keys. Alternatively, the second player can be set to be controlled by the AI, with both "Easy", "Medium" and "Hard" difficulties available. Lastly, the spacebar key can be pressed, in order to pause or unpause the game.
